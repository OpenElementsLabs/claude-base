# Review Implementation Against Specification

Verify that an implementation fully satisfies its specification by checking the code against the design document and behavioral scenarios.

Before starting, read `../../docs/spec-driven-development.md` for the full spec folder structure and file formats.

## Instructions

### 1. Identify the spec

Ask the user which spec to review, or detect it from context. Locate the spec folder under `specs/` and read both `design.md` and `behaviors.md` completely.

### 2. Review against `design.md`

Check the codebase for each element defined in the design:

- **API design** — Are all endpoints/interfaces implemented with the correct signatures, status codes, and response shapes?
- **Data model** — Are all entities, fields, relationships, and migrations present?
- **Key flows** — Does the code implement the described execution paths?
- **Dependencies** — Are the specified libraries/services integrated correctly?
- **Security considerations** — Are the described security measures in place?

For each item, classify it as:
- **Covered** — Fully implemented as designed
- **Partially covered** — Implemented but deviates from the design or is incomplete
- **Missing** — Not implemented at all
- **Intentionally skipped** — Not applicable (explain why)

### 3. Review against `behaviors.md`

For each given-when-then scenario:

- Check if a corresponding **test exists** (unit test, integration test, or e2e test)
- Check if the **code behavior matches** the scenario even without a dedicated test
- Flag scenarios that are **not covered by any test**

Classify each scenario as:
- **Tested** — A test directly covers this scenario
- **Implemented but untested** — The code handles this case but no test verifies it
- **Not implemented** — The behavior described in the scenario is missing from the code

### 4. Report

Present a structured report:

```markdown
## Design Coverage

| Design Element | Status | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| ...           | ...    | ...   |

## Behavior Coverage

| Scenario | Status | Test Location |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| ...      | ...    | ...          |

## Summary

- X of Y design elements covered
- X of Y behavioral scenarios tested
- X scenarios implemented but untested
- X scenarios not implemented

## Recommended Actions

1. ...
```

### 5. Discuss with the user

Walk through the findings. For missing or partially covered items, discuss whether they are:
- Oversights that need to be fixed
- Intentional deviations that should be reflected back in the spec
- Out of scope for the current iteration

If the spec needs to be updated to reflect implementation decisions, offer to update `design.md` or `behaviors.md` accordingly.
